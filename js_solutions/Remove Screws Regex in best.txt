Task:
John is a worker, His job is to remove the screws from the machine.

A parameters ```screws``` will be given by a string, like this: ```"---+++"```, ```"-" and "+"``` are two type of screws.

John have two screwdrivers: slotted screwdriver and cross screwdriver. slotted screwdriver can remove screw "-", cross screwdriver can remove screw "+".

When John began to work, he stood in the first screw, with a screwdriver in his hand(He is always holding a screwdriver that can screw out the first one), another screwdriver in his tool kit.

He works from left to right, remove the screws, when the different types of screws appear, he will replace his screwdriver and continue his work.

Some actions and time consuming:
```
remove one screw :               1 second
move to adjacent screw position: 1 second
replace different screwdriver:   5 seconds
```
Our task is to calculate the total time when he removed these screws. return a number.

Specific time calculation to see the following example:

My Solution:

function sc(screws){
let switchDriver = -5 
let totalScrews = screws.length * 2 - 1; 
for (let i = 0; i < screws.length; i++) {
 if (screws[i] !== screws[i+1]) {
  switchDriver += 5
}
}
return switchDriver + totalScrews
}
sc("---+++")
16

Best Solution:

function sc(screws){
  return screws.split('').reduce((time, screw, i) => screw == screws[i+1] ? time + 2 : time + 7, 1) - 7;
}

OR

function sc(a){return 2*a.length+5*a.replace(/(.)\1*/g,'$1').length-6}
