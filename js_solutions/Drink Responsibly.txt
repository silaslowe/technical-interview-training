Task
Codewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.

Your fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form of a string. Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you should drink to not be hungover.

Examples
"1 beer"  =>  "1 glass of water"
"1 shot, 5 beers and 1 glass of wine"  =>  "7 glasses of water"
Notes
To keep the things simple, we'll consider that anything with a number in front of it is a drink: "1 bear" => "1 glass of water" or "1 chainsaw and 2 pools" => "3 glasses of water"
The number in front of each drink lies in range [1; 9]


My Solution:

function hydrate(s) {
  let water = s.match(/\d/g).map(Number).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  if (water > 1) { 
  return water + " glasses of water"
} else {
  return water + " glass of water"
}
}
hydrate("1 shot")

Other Solution:

hydrate=(s,sum=0)=>(sum=s.match(/\d+/g).reduce((x,y)=>x+ +y,0))+` glass${(sum > 1 ? "es" : "")} of water`;
