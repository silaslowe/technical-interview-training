Task:
The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

Examples:
tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES 
tickets([25, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100])

My Solution:

function tickets(peopleInLine){
  let twentyFive = 0
  let fifty = 0
   if (twentyFive < 0 || fifty < 0) {
   return "NO"
} else {
   for (let person in peopleInLine) {
   switch (peopleInLine[person]) {
    case 25: 
      twentyFive += 1;
      if (twentyFive < 0) {
   return "NO"
}
      break;
    case 50: 
      twentyFive -= 1;
       if (twentyFive < 0) {
      return "NO"
      }
      fifty += 1;
      if (twentyFive < 0) {
      return "NO"
      }
      break;
      case 100:
      if (fifty < 1) {
      twentyFive -= 3
} else {
      twentyFive -=1;
      fifty -= 1;
} 
      if (twentyFive < 0 || fifty < 0) {
      return "NO"
      } 
      break; 
}
}
return "YES"
}
}

Best Solution:
function tickets(peopleInLine){
  let [c25,c50,c100] = [0,0,0];
  for(let v of peopleInLine) {
    if(v===25) c25++;
    if(v===50) {c50++; c25--;}
    if(v===100) {c25--; c50>0?c50--:c25-=2;}
    if(c25<0||c50<0) return 'NO'
  }
  return 'YES'
}
