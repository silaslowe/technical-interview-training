Task
Implement a function which finds the numbers less than 2, and the indices of numbers greater than 1 in the given sequence, and returns them as a pair of sequences.

Return a nested array or a tuple depending on the language:

The first sequence being only the 1s and 0s from the original sequence.
The second sequence being the indexes of the elements greater than 1 in the original sequence.
Examples
[ 0, 1, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 1, 1, 0 ] => [ [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 ], [ 2, 4, 5, 6 ] ]

My Solution:

function binaryCleaner(arr) {
  let oneOrLess = arr.filter(num => num <= 1);
  let index = [];
  let result = [oneOrLess, index]
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   if (arr[i] > 1) {
    index.push(i)
    }
  }
return result
}

Other Solution:

function binaryCleaner(a) {
  let r = [[], []];
  a.map((x, i) => x < 2 ? r[0].push(x) : r[1].push(i));
  return r;
}

function binaryCleaner(arr) {
  return [arr.filter(x => x <= 1), arr.map((x,i) => [x,i]).filter((x, i) => x[0] > 1).map(x => x[1])];
}
