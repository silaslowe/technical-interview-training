Task

Four men, a, b, c and d are standing in a line, one behind another.

There's a wall between the first three people (a, b and c) and the last one (d).

a, b and c are lined up in order of height, so that person a can see the backs of b and c, person b can see the back of c, and c can see just the wall.

There are 4 hats, 2 black and 2 white. Each person is given a hat. None of them can see their own hat, but person a can see the hats of b and c, while person b can see the hat of person c. Neither c nor d can see any hats.

Once a person figures out their hat's color, they shouts it.

My answer:

function guessHatColor(a,b,c,d) {
  if (b === "white" && c === "white") {
return 1}
  if (b === "black" && c === "black") {
  return 1
} else { 
  return 2
}
}

guessHatColor("black","white","black","white")


Other Solution:

guessHatColor = (a, b, c, d) => b == c ? 1 : 2;
