A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return True if yes, False otherwise :)


My Solution
def hero(bullets, dragons):
  victory = bullets/dragons
  if victory >= 2:
  	print(True)
  else: 
  	print(False)

Better Solutions

def hero(bullets, dragons):
    return bullets >= dragons * 2

hero = lambda b,d: 2*d<=b
