This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.

Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, you have NO CONTROL over its value.

Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.

My Solution:

def pre_fizz(n):
    arr = []
    x = range(1,n+1,1)
    for n in x:
        arr.append(n)
    return arr 

Other Solutions:

def pre_fizz(n):
    return list(range(1, n+1))
